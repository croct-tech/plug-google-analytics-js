## Installation

The recommended way to install this plugin is using NPM. It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as Rollup, Webpack or Browserify and includes Typescript typings.

Run the following command to install the latest version:

```sh
npm install @croct/plug-google-analytics
```

## Basic usage

```typescript
import croct from '@croct/plug';
// Install the plugin
import '@croct/plug-google-analytics';

croct.plug({
    plugins: {
        googleAnalytics: {
            category: 'Croct',
            rateLimit: 1000,
            events: {
                eventOccurred: true,
                testGroupAssigned: false,
            },
            customEvents: {
                customEventName: true,
            },
        },
    }
});
```

Notice that all Analytics libraries implement a [rate-limiting mechanism](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/limits-quotas) 
that ensures you don't send too many hits at once, meaning that some events can be lost. The "rateLimit" option 
allows you to limit the maximum number of hits in a given interval. For example, passing 500ms causes the function 
to be called at most one time per 500ms ‚Äì or two times per second.

Note that although calls are queued for execution but never ignored, events can still be lost if the user leaves 
the page before all events are sent to Analytics.
